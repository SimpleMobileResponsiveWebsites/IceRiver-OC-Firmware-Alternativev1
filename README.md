Project Focus: 

The core of this project revolves around creating custom firmware for IceRiver ASICs.

This firmware provides enhanced functionality such as:

●Configurable clock and voltage offsets.

●Improved fan controls.

●Additional telemetry and graphing of chip metrics and hashrates
.
●Uptime and job rate monitoring.

●Chip temperature monitoring.

●Real-time voltage and clock displays.

●Primary pool health monitoring.

●A new API over HTTPS.

●General UI improvements.

●Stability and security enhancements.

●TLS certificate management.

●Healthcheck loop.

●Fee structure which is currently 1% for the base version, and a commercial/hosting version with a 1.33% fee.


Key aspects to consider for the name:

●IceRiver ASIC Specificity: The project is clearly tailored for IceRiver ASICs.

●Overclocking Emphasis: A significant feature is the ability to overclock and control voltage.

●Custom Firmware Nature: The project involves modifying the original firmware.

●Security: The new firmware addresses security issues with the stock firmware, and provides TLS certificate management.

●Enhanced Monitoring: The project adds significant monitoring and diagnostic features
